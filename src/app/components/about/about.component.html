          <p>Born from a real need for safer riding.</p>
          <p>
            Like many meaningful innovations, the Mantis Mirror System started with a moment that demanded a better solution.
            Founder Mike Kelly, a lifelong cyclist, was riding on open roads using a standard helmet mirror. While in a lower, more
            aerodynamic position, he couldn&rsquo;t see approaching traffic behind him. Riding near the outer edge of the bike lane due to
            gravel, a passing truck came closer than expected &mdash; a moment that could have been avoided with better rear visibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            That experience led to a simple realization:
            cyclists need a way to see behind them in any riding position, without having to readjust their mirror while moving.
          </p>
          <p>
            From that point forward, Mike spent several years refining the design, engineering multiple prototypes, testing materials,
            and validating the concept with riders across different disciplines. The result is the Mantis Mirror System &mdash; a dual-position,
            detachable helmet-mounted mirror that expands rear field of view whether you ride upright, in a tuck, or anywhere in between.
          </p>

            To confirm interest and test pricing, Mike conducted market research showing that over 94% of cyclists feel uneasy riding near
            vehicles. A successful Kickstarter campaign in 2025 helped validate demand and fund the first production run, all made here in Canada.
          </p>

            Today, the Mantis Mirror System is available to riders everywhere who want a practical way to increase their rear visibility and ride with more confidence.
            Bike safe. Stay aware. Ride farther.

            Fun fact: the praying mantis &mdash; the inspiration for our name &mdash; has among the best eyesight in the insect world, with two
            forward-facing eyes designed for detecting movement and depth with incredible accuracy.
