                <strong>The Mantis™ Mirror System</strong>
                differs greatly from all other currently available bicycle mirrors, in that it allows the rider to view rear approaching objects, from any position the rider assumes, without having to readjust the mirrors once initially setup – this increases safety, comfort and overall convenience while riding. The Mantis™ Mirror System provides for a solid attachment to the helmet, thus greatly reducing any possible road vibration induced issues. It is also easily removable; has a multitude of angular/ height adjustments for the riders; offers two front reflectors to allow on coming traffic to see you better; has a novel marking system to allow the rider to more quickly set the system up on future rides; has a “walking” mode which allows the system to be quickly raised up (eliminating the problem of the mirrors making contact with anything around you when off your bike).

                  <strong>Upright bikes (hybrid, city, commuter, e-bike):</strong>
                  When the system is in position &ldquo;0&rdquo; and the lower mirror is set correctly, you should require virtually no head turn, if at all.
                  Because of how the arm angles the mirror, most riders simply shift their eyes slightly left to get a clear rear view.
                  For upright cyclists, this is typically a true &ldquo;eyes-only&rdquo; glance.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <strong>Road bikes / drop-bar bikes:</strong>
                  Road cyclists naturally ride with more spinal flexion and a lower torso angle, so you&rsquo;ll use position &ldquo;15&rdquo; when using either the lower mirror or upper mirror.
                </p>
                <ul class="mb-3">
                  <li>When sitting upright or standing: you&rsquo;ll check the lower mirror, which will require a small head turn.</li>
                  <li>When in a more aerodynamic/low position: you&rsquo;ll use the upper mirror, requiring a slightly bigger head turn.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-3">
                  Because the Mantis™ Mirror System provides excellent clarity and a wide field of view, any head turn is extremely brief &mdash; usually just a split second.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-0">
                  Without the Mantis™ Mirror System, most riders need to turn their heads much farther, see far less behind them, and may even affect their balance.
                  No bike mirror is perfect, but the Mantis™ Mirror System is designed to get much closer by maximizing rear visibility with minimal disruption to how you ride.

                  <strong>Short answer:</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  The aerodynamic effect of the Mantis<sup>TM</sup> is extremely small &mdash; typically well under 1% of a rider&rsquo;s
                  total drag &mdash; and usually costs about 1&ndash;2 watts at race speeds (40&ndash;50 km/h). For most riders, this is far less
                  than the watt difference caused by clothing flapping, hand position, or even slight changes in body posture.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <strong>Technical summary:</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                  Because each mirror is only 1.25&quot; in diameter and sits in the helmet&rsquo;s airflow, the added frontal area is tiny
                  (about 0.0015 m²). In practical terms, this increases total CdA by ~0.5&ndash;0.7%, which equates to roughly:
                </p>
                <ul class="mb-4">
                  <li>0.3&ndash;0.5 W at 30 km/h</li>
                  <li>0.7&ndash;1.2 W at 40 km/h</li>
                  <li>1.5&ndash;2.0 W at 50 km/h</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  Over a 40 km ride at typical power (200&ndash;300 W), this amounts to around 6&ndash;7 seconds difference &mdash; well within
                  normal daily variation from wind, road texture, or helmet angle.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <strong>But here&rsquo;s the important part:</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                  Most riders lose far more time and energy when they have to briefly sit up, rise out of aero, or glance over a
                  shoulder to check behind them. Even one or two &ldquo;pop-ups&rdquo; per ride can cost more energy and more seconds than
                  the Mantis&rsquo;s aerodynamic cost.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  With the Mantis, riders can stay lower and more consistent in their position because rear awareness no longer
                  requires sitting upright to check traffic.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-3">
                  <strong>Real-world net effect:</strong>
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  For many cyclists &mdash; especially on open roads or during longer rides &mdash; the ability to maintain a stable,
                  lower position more often can actually save more drag than the mirrors create, producing a net benefit in both
                  speed and efficiency.
                </p>
                <p class="mb-4">
                  <strong>In short:</strong>
                  The Mantis adds only a watt or two of drag, but can easily save more than that by letting you stay lower, longer
                  and more aware of vehicles behind you &mdash; while interrupting your rhythm much less.

                  The Mantis Mirror System is designed to be extremely lightweight so it stays unobtrusive while riding.
                  Because of that, it’s easy to forget it’s still attached afterward, and the extended arm can catch on jackets,
                  car interiors, or bags.
