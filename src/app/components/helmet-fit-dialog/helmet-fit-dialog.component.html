<h2 mat-dialog-title>Will the Mantis Mirror System Fit My Helmet?</h2>
<mat-dialog-content>
  <p>
    Great question—there are many helmet designs out there so we're not going to say we are 100% compatible with all helmets.
    So, the short answer here is: <strong>most likely, yes</strong> (as we've looked at many helmets).
  </p>

  <p class="important-note">
    <strong>Important Note:</strong> This version of the Mantis Mirror System is designed for <strong>left-side helmet use</strong> (for right-hand
    traffic regions <strong>like in North America</strong> — including Canada, the U.S., and Mexico).
  </p>
  <p>
    A right-side version for left-hand traffic regions (e.g., the U.K., Australia) is in development.
  </p>
  <p>
    The Mantis Mirror System includes a <strong>Base Mount</strong> plus two <strong>adapter wedges</strong> (and in rare cases, both wedges can be stacked).
    As shown in the image above, these options help accommodate various helmet curvatures.
  </p>
  <p>
    To ensure proper alignment using Mantis’s proprietary marking system, the Base Mount needs to be installed <strong>vertically
    upright</strong> on a clean, flat section of your helmet (just above the ear area). The 3M adhesive comes pre-applied for easy
    installation.
  </p>
  <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Helmet #1</strong> has a near-vertical flat surface—<strong>no wedge needed.</strong></li>
    <li><strong>Helmet #2</strong> curves slightly, so the <strong>small wedge</strong> is used.</li>
    <li><strong>Helmet #3</strong> curves even more, requiring the <strong>medium wedge</strong>.</li>
  </ul>

  </figure>
  <p>
    For helmets with aggressive venting or ridges along the entire sides, ensure that <strong>at least the upper portion (1/2" or more)</strong>
    of the Base Mount has direct contact with a flat surface. A wedge can then fill in the lower gap if needed.

    A clear installation video is included with your order to walk you through the process step-by-step.
