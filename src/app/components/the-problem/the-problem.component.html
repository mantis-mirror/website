      <p class="problem__lead">
        The roads are busier than ever, distractions are everywhere, and traditional mirrors haven’t kept up with the pace of
        modern cycling.

        <h3>Escalating distractions</h3>
        <p>
          Biking has become less safe because of increased road traffic and distracted driving. When you can’t see what’s behind
          you, every ride can feel like an accident waiting to happen.

        <h3>Staggering statistics</h3>
        <p>
          Nearly 400,000 preventable bicycle accidents occur every year, with many caused by vehicles approaching from the rear.
          Bike riding fatalities continue to rise, with almost 1,300 deaths in the U.S. alone during 2020.

        <h3>Traditional mirrors fall short</h3>
        <p>
          Older single-mirror solutions limit visibility. They don’t adapt as you shift your position, forcing riders to
          readjust mid-ride — a risky move when focus should stay on the road ahead.

        <h3>The human cost</h3>
        <p>
          Shoulder checks, twisting, and turning disrupt cadence, waste energy, and impact balance. Riders deserve a smarter way
          to stay informed about what’s coming up behind them.
