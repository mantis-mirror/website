            Biking should feel freeing, yet modern roads tell a different story. More vehicles and more distractions mean riders
            are often unaware of what is approaching from behind.
            <span class="highlight">Knowing what is around you is essential for confident riding.</span>

            Nearly 400,000 preventable bicycle accidents occur every year, many caused by rear-approaching vehicles. Bike riding
            fatalities have continued to rise, with nearly 1,300 deaths in 2020 in the U.S. alone. Bicycle deaths accounted for
            2% of all motor-vehicle traffic fatalities (National Safety Council 2022).

            Traditional bicycle mirrors try to help, but their single mirror design limits visibility. Riders have to reposition
            the mirror—or themselves—just to get a usable view. Doing that in traffic is distracting and dangerous.

            The science and stats are clear: there must be a better way to protect riders and preserve their flow. <strong>That
            solution is the Mantis™ Mirror System.</strong>

            <li>Single-mirror designs leave massive blind spots and require constant readjustment mid-ride.</li>
